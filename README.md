A game I started making for a school project but hopefully will develop into a full game.

The only dependency this has is rust and cargo

If a question isn't continuing, and instead seems confused you are most likely answering it like a short answer instead of like [y/n]

You can answer with n for north, s for south, etc
similarly [y/n] questions can be answered like [yes/no]

Answers aren't case sensitive
