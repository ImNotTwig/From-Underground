# From-Underground
A game I started making for a school project but hopefully will develop into a full game.

Installation Instructions

  download the source code zip file and unzip into a directory of your choosing

  The only dependency this has is rust and cargo
  https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

  Once you've installed rust you open the From-Underground folder in a terminal and run "cargo run" without the quotes



If a question isn't continuing, and instead seems confused you are most likely answering it like a short answer instead of like [y/n]

You can answer with n for north, s for south, etc

similarly [y/n] questions can be answered like [yes/no]

Answers aren't case sensitive
